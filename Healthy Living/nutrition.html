            <h2>Why Nutrition Matters</h2>
            <p><strong>Macronutrients:</strong> Macronutrients are nutrients that provide 
                calories or energy. They include carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.</p>
  
            <p><strong>Carbohydrates:</strong> Carbohydrates are the body's main source of 
                energy. They are found in foods like bread, pasta, rice, and fruits.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Proteins:</strong> Proteins are essential for building and repairing tissues. 
                Good sources include meat, fish, eggs, and legumes.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Fats:</strong> Fats are important for energy, insulation, and cell function. 
                Healthy fats come from sources like avocados, nuts, and olive oil.</p>
          
            <p><strong>Micronutrients:</strong> Micronutrients are essential vitamins and minerals 
                that the body needs in smaller amounts but are crucial for various functions.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Vitamins:</strong> Vitamins such as Vitamin C (found in citrus fruits) and 
                Vitamin D (obtained from sunlight and certain foods) support immune function and bone 
                health, respectively.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Minerals:</strong> Minerals like calcium (from dairy products) and iron 
                (in red meat and leafy greens) are necessary for bone strength and oxygen transport 
                in the blood.</p>
          
            <p><strong>Hydration:</strong> Water is essential for digestion, temperature regulation, 
                and nutrient transport. It is recommended to drink at least 8 glasses of water per 
                day.</p>
          
            <p><strong>Healthy Eating Habits:</strong> Adopting a balanced diet that includes a variety 
                of foods ensures adequate nutrient intake for overall health and well-being.</p>
          
            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Proper nutrition is vital for maintaining optimal health. 
                By understanding and practicing good nutrition habits, individuals can support their 
                physical and mental well-being.</p><br>
