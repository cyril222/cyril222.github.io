                <p>
                    Mental health is an integral part of overall well-being. It involves emotional, 
                    psychological, and social aspects of health. Maintaining good mental health requires 
                    attention to various factors.

                <h2>Stress Management:</h2>
                <p>
                    Techniques such as mindfulness, meditation, deep breathing exercises, and 
                    journaling can help manage stress levels.
                    Engaging in hobbies and activities that bring joy and relaxation is also 
                    beneficial.<p><br>

                <h2>Social Connections:</h2>
                <p>
                    Building and maintaining strong relationships with family, friends, and 
                    community members provides emotional support and a sense of belonging.
                    Participate in social activities, join clubs, or volunteer to foster connections.
                </p><br>
                
                <h2>Professional Support:</h2>
                <p>
                    Seeking therapy or counseling when needed can provide tools and strategies 
                    to cope with life's challenges and improve mental health.
                    Mental health professionals can offer support and guidance for 
                    managing conditions such as anxiety, depression, and stress.

                <h2>Self-Care:</h2>
                <p>
                    Engaging in self-care activities, such as taking time for oneself, practicing 
                    gratitude, and setting boundaries, is crucial for mental well-being.
                    Regularly engaging in activities that promote relaxation and joy can improve 
                    overall mental health.
